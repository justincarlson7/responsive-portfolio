                I studied photography while an undergraduate at the University of North Carolina at Asheville more than
                a decade ago, but I've been shooting photos since my parents gave me my first Nikon when I was 14 years
                old. The quality of my work has certainly improved over the years, but my love of photography hasn't
                wavered a bit since I shot that first portrait of my parents by their 1982 Ford Granada.

                I was very proud of that photo. I'm proud of the work I did as a staff newspaper photographer. And I'm
                proud of the pictures I've taken documenting important moments for people in Raleigh, the Triangle and
                around the state.

                The creative examples I've posted on this site are representative of what you can expect from my
                projects.

                While being a bit of a perfectionist, my style is relaxed, unobtrusive and low-key.
